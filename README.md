# GrasureOL
A distributed version of Grasure with powerful Web and DB support.

## Targets
Basically, we adopt Grausre as the core fullfilling functionalities like writing, reading, and recovering.
And a pretty-looking HTTP frontend.


This project is governed by Durant Thorvalds since 13th, April, 2022.


Our goal is to forge an atomic, simple-to-study, highly module-independant and integratable project.
